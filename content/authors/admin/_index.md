Welcome! I am a doctoral researcher and teaching assistant at the [Department of Political Science](https://www.tcd.ie/Political_Science/) at [Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/). I am also a member of the [Research School on Peace & Conflict](http://www.peaceconflictresearch.org/) at the [Peace Research Institute Oslo](https://www.prio.org/).  I earned a B.A. and M.A. in Political Science from the [University of Mannheim](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/en/) and an M.A. in International Relations (Research Track) from the [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/).

My research interests are explaining and predicting political violence and instability. This includes, but is not limited to, terrorism & insurgencies, civil conflicts, and international conflict. Methodologically, I am interested in both frequentist and Bayesian statistics, computational social science, formal models, spatial analyses and multi-method research. My dissertation seeks to explain and predict the adoption, timing, and location of terrorism in civil conflicts. My work has been published in *International Studies Quarterly*.
